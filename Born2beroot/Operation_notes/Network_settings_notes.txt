Network Settings (Bridged Adapter)

    If your VM's network adapter is set to Bridged Adapter,
    this means that the VM should act like it's directly
	connected to the network, with its own IP address separate
	from the host machine.

    You should check the IP address of the VM:

    hostname -I

    Use the output of this IP address instead of 127.0.1.1.
	The IP address 127.0.1.1 is a loopback address used by the
	host machine, and it might not be the correct one for the VM.

Test the Correct IP Address

    After confirming the correct IP address of your VM, try
	connecting using that address:

		ssh suroh@<VM_IP_Address> -p 4242


but when the settings are in NAT

its a little different.
