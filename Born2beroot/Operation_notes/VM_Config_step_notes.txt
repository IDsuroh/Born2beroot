        *username: Replace this with the actual username you want to
            grant privileges to. This is the user for whom the privileges are
            being defined.
        *ALL: The first ALL refers to the hosts where this rule applies.
            Typically, it means the rule applies to all hosts, which is
            common in single-machine setups.
        *(ALL): The second ALL inside the parentheses specifies the target
            user for the command. In this case, it allows the user to run
            commands as any user, including the root user.
        *ALL: The last ALL means the user can run all commands with sudo
            privileges.
