Options (Enforce Password Policy):    /etc/pam.d/common-password

    retry=3:
This allows the user up to 3 attempts to enter a valid password that meets the requirements before failing.

    minlen=10:
Specifies that the minimum length of the password must be 10 characters.

    ucredit=-1:
Requires at least one uppercase letter (-1 means the minimum number of uppercase characters).

    lcredit=-1:
Requires at least one lowercase letter.

    dcredit=-1:
Requires at least one digit.

    maxrepeat=3:
Limits the number of times a character can repeat consecutively in a password
          (e.g., aaa is allowed but not aaaa).

    reject_username:
Prevents the user from using their username or any part of it as a password.

    difok=7:
Specifies that at least 7 characters of the new password must be different from the previous password.

    enforce_for_root:
This enforces the same password policies for the root user, not just regular users.



Defaults Settings in sudoers

    Defaults env_reset
        - Resets the environment to a secure default when running sudo.
            prevents unauthorized access through potentially insecure
            environment variables.
        - Clears out environment variables that could be used to
            bypass security restrictions.

    Defaults mail_badpass
        - Sends an email to the administrator when an incorrect password
            is entered for sudo.
        - Provides an alert if someone fails to authenticate using sudo,
            which can be useful for monitoring failed access attempts.

    Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
        - Sets a secure path for commands run with sudo, ensuring that
            only specific directories are searched for executables.
        - Reduces the risk of executing malicious or unintended commands
            by restricting the executable paths.

    Defaults badpass_message="Password is wrong, please try again!"
        - Customizes the error message displayed when an incorrect password\
            is entered.
        - Provides a user-friendly message indicating a password error.

    Defaults passwd_tries=3
        - Limits the number of password attempts to 3 before giving up.
        - Prevents endless retry attempts and improves security by
            locking out the user after several failed attempts.

    Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
        - Specifies the location of the log file where sudo command
            usage is recorded.
        - Allows monitoring and auditing of sudo commands for security
            and compliance purposes.

    Defaults log_input, log_output
        - Logs both the input and output of commands executed with sudo.
        - Provides a record of what was typed and the results of the
            commands, which can be useful for auditing.

    Defaults requiretty
        - Requires that sudo commands be run from a terminal (tty).
        - Prevents sudo from being run in environments without a proper
            terminal, adding a layer of security by ensuring interactive
            use.


Differences Between passwd_tries and retry=3

    passwd_tries:
        - Limits the number of attempts a user can make to enter the correct
            password when using sudo.
        - It is specific to sudo and does not affect password changes or other
            authentication mechanisms outside sudo.

    retry=3:
        - Part of the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) configuration and
            applies to password management across the system.
        - It controls how many times a user can retry entering a valid password
            when changing or setting a new password.


Why Both Settings?

    Different Scope
        - "passwd_tries" controls the number of attempts for sudo commands
            specifically.
        - "retry=3" controls password attempts for the entire system's
            password management.
    
    Complementary Security
        - Using both settings provides layered security.
        - 'passwd_tries' setting in sudoers ensures that users cannot
            keep trying to use sudo with incorrect passwords
        - 'retry=3' setting in PAM ensures that password changes or settings
            have their own retry limits.
