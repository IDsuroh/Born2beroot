***tty? the tty device is a tool to show text output.

short answer:
When it comes to Linux, TTY is an abstract device in UNIX and Linux.
Sometimes it refers to a physical input device such as a serial port,
and sometimes it refers to a virtual TTY where it allows users to
interact with the system (reference).

TTY is a subsystem in Linux and Unix that makes process management,
line editing, and session management possible at the kernel level
through TTY drivers.

history:
A teleprinter is an electromechanical device that can be used to
send and receive typed messages through various communications channels
in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint configurations.
Initially they were used in telegraphy, which developed in the late
1830s and 1840s as the first use of electrical engineering,
though teleprinters were not used for telegraphy until 1887 at the earliest.
The machines were adapted to provide a user interface to
early mainframe computers and minicomputers, sending typed data
to the computer and printing the response.

A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device
that can be used for entering data into, and transcribing data from,
a computer or a computing system. The teletype was an example of
an early day hardcopy terminal, and predated the use of a computer screen by decades.
Early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow compared to punched cards
or paper tape for input, but as the technology improved and video displays
were introduced, terminals pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry.
