Installing and Configuring SSH (Secure Shell Host)

to install package (openssh server): <- a software needed to set up an SSH
        sudo apt install openssh-server

to check SSH Server Status:
        sudo systemctl status ssh

        sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Find line:
        #Port22
    
Change to:
        Port 4242 without the # (Hash) in front of it

Save and Exit Vim

to check if the port settings are right:
        sudo grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo: Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges
        because reading or modifying system files like
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config usually requires administrative
        access.

grep: A command-line tool used to search for patterns or
        specific text within files. In this case, it's
        searching for the word "Port."

Port: The search term. It is commonly used in the SSH
        configuration to specify the port number on
        which the SSH service listens.

/etc/ssh/sshd_config: This is the configuration file
        for the SSH server (sshd), which controls settings
        like the port number, allowed authentication
        methods, and security options.


to restart the SSH Service
        sudo service ssh restart
         ""  systemd    ""
