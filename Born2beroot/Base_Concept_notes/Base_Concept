***BASE CONCEPT***

	Virtual Machine - virtualization concept that allows different OS to run in the same hardware.

	Hypervisor - technology that allows virtualization to be possible. Allows multiple virtual computers to be hosted into just one computer.

	e.g. VirtualBox by Oracle

	- Creates virtual CPU, RAM, Storage
	- Hardware resources are shared
	- Completely isolated

	Type 2 & Type 1 Hypervisor

	Type 1 = Bare Metal Hypervisor
	Big servers
	- Hypervisor is installed directly on the Hardware.
	- Controls the Hardware resources directly.
		e.g. vmware. Microsoft Hyper-v
	- For Servers.
	- Big Companies and Big Cloud Platforms utilize this hypervisor.
	- Efficient usage of hardware resources.
	- Abstraction of the Operating System from the hardware.
	- Can have backups or SNAPSHOTS of the 'Virtual Machine Image' (VMI).
