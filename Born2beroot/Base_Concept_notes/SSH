************ WHAT IS A 'SHELL' IN COMPUTER SCIENCE? ***********
***************************************************************
{'Shell' is a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a
	keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination. Basically it is your interface to the
	operating system and the outermost layer of the operating system. It incorporates a programming language to control processes and files
	as well as to start and control other programs.												}

	WHAT IS SSH?
	- stands for secure shell.
	- creating a shell on another machine remotely over the internet or local area connection or some network connection.
	- opens a series of channels that allows to multiplex or have multiple connections over the data.
	- can use SSH for things other than secure shell.
	e.g.
		can send files
		remotely edit files using 'SFTP'
		tunnel 'http' traffic and use like a 'VPN'
	
	How an SSH packet looks like:
				__________________
				| 	         |	 {\Shows the length of the packet. Doesn't
				| Packet length  |	 include the packet length segment. 4 bytes in
				|________________|	 size./}
				|	         |	 {\Shows length of the padding data. 1 byte in
				| Padding length |	 size. Padding length is mixed in with Payload
				|________________|	 before it is encrypted./} 
				|	         |	 { \\\Main data of send. Pieces of a file.///
				|    Payload     |	 Padding length + Payload + Padding data
				|________________|			\All encrypted./	   }
				|	         | 
				|  Padding data  |
				|________________|
				|_______MAC______|	 { Message Authentication Code.	   }

	*Packet length and MAC are not encrypted.
	
	Packet length:
		- because TCP is going to use the packet length to identify how big the packet is.
		- TCP is going to handle the flow of the data from one point to another.
		
	MAC (Message authentication code):
		- necessary to verify that the Payload is not corrupted.
		- the 'hash' of the Payload.
	
	FUN FACT!
{	Before SSH, there were other protocls to handle the remote connection like telnet. It would send everything into plain text.
Developed 1969. But by 1995, when SSH was created, encrypted connections started to be necessary because anybody could hack or be sniffing
traffic on any network between people. It started to be dangerous since hackers would capture the connection packets to get personal
login credentials, details, and so on and so forth.											}



***How does SSH work?***

        1. TCP/IP

				- TCP -						- IP -
                - stands for Transmission Control Protocol         - stands for Internet Protocol.


                - SSH runs on top of the TCP/IP protocol suite—which much of the Internet relies upon.
		- TCP/IP pairs those two protocols in order to format, route, and deliver packets.
		- IP indicates which IP address a packet should go to
			(think of a mailing address)
		- TCP indicates which port a packet should go to at each IP address
			(think of the floor of a building or an apartment number).

		TCP is a transport layer protocol:
			 - it is concerned with the transportation and delivery of data packets.
 			 - usually, additional protocols are used on top of TCP/IP in order to put the transmitted data in a form that applications can use.
			 - SSH is one such protocol.
				(Other examples include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.)

	2. Public key cryptography
		- SSH is "secure" because it incorporates encryption and authentication via a process called public key cryptography.
		- public key cryptography is a way to encrypt data, or sign data, with two different keys.
		- the public key, is available for anyone to use.
		- the private key, is kept secret by its owner.
		- the two keys correspond to each other, establishing the key owner's identity requires possession of the private key that goes with the public key.
		- These "asymmetric" keys — so called because they have different values — 
			- make it possible for the two sides of the connection
			- to negotiate identical, shared symmetric keys for further encryption over the channel.
			- Once this negotiation is complete, the two sides use the symmetric keys to encrypt the data they exchange.

	{	In an SSH connection, both sides have a public/private key pair, and each side authenticates the other using these keys.
			This differentiates SSH from HTTPS, which in most implementations only verifies the identity of the web server in
			a client-server connection. (Other differences include that HTTPS usually does not allow the client to access the
			server's command line,and that firewalls sometimes block SSH but almost never block HTTPS.)				}

	3. Authentication
		- often this takes the form of entering a username and password.
		- additional method of safety other than just SSH.
		- Once authentication is complete, the person can execute commands on the remote machine as if they were doing so on their own local machine.

	4. SSH tunneling, or 'port forwarding'
	
		- Port forwarding 
			forwarding a message between two people.
			
			e.g.)	
		Bob may send a message to Alice, who in turn passes it to Dave. 
			
				BOB ------send------> Alice ------pass------> Dave
					 message		 message

		{Similarly, port forwarding sends "DATA PACKETS" directed at an IP address and port on one machine
			to an IP address and port on a different machine.					}

			e.g.)
		An administrator wants to make a change on a server 	      |
		inside a private network they manage and 		      |			admin <- wants to make change on a (server)
		they want to do so from a remote location. 		      |		(remote location) 	away from	(private network)
									      |
		For security reasons, that server only receives		      |		(server)				(private network)
		data packets from other computers within the private network. |			only recieves data packets within this network
									      |
		The administrator could instead connect to a second server    |		( private network -----(second server)------ ) 
		within the network and then use	SSH 'PORT FORWARDING' 	      |					one that is open to receiving Internet traffic 
		to connect to the first server.				      |			admin -----can connect----> (second server)
									      |			admin use SSH PORT FORWARDING------------> connect to (first server)
		From the first server's perspective, the administrator's      |
		data packets are coming from inside the private network.      |		 ( private network ------(admin's data packet)------ ) ---> (server)
									      |	reality: 
									      |	( private network ------( second server ------(admin's data packet)------) )
									      | -----------SSH PORT FORWARDING----------> (first server)
									      |

	5. Using SSH
		- Linux and Mac operating systems come with SSH built in. 
		- Windows machines may need to have an SSH client application installed.
		- On Mac and Linux computers, users can open the Terminal application and directly enter SSH commands.
