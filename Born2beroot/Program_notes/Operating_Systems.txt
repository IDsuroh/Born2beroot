'Debian' - is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software
            and optionally non-free firmware or software developed by the
            community-supported Debian Project, which was established by
            Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993.

'Rocky' - 'Rocky' Linux is an open-source enterprise operating system designed
            to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux®.

{'Debian' Linux has a long-standing reputation for its robustness, stability,
    and massive software repositories, making it a versatile option for
    various server applications. On the other hand, 'Rocky' OS could be a
    more suitable choice with its substantial similarity to
    ***'Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)' and superior support for
    Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).

    *** 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)' is an enterprise Linux operating
            system (OS) developed by Red Hat for the business market.
            'RHEL', formerly known as Red Hat Linux Advanced Server,
            is certified with thousands of vendors and across hundreds
            of clouds.

Pros of Rocky Linux:
    
    Compatibility: Transitioning from 'Rocky' OS to 'RHEL' is relatively seamless.
                        The similarity between the two systems means your
                        team will not have to learn a new system from scratch,
                        as the commands, software management, and system
                        configuration will be familiar.
    
    Cost-effectiveness: being free and open-source, 'Rocky' OS offers an economical
                        way to familiarize yourself with an RHEL-like environment
                        without the upfront costs associated with RHEL.

    While 'Debian' and 'Rocky' OS both support SELinux, 'Rocky' OS integrates it more closely,
		echoing the strong SELinux policies of RHEL.

	'Debian' uses AppArmor as its primary mandatory access control system.

	'Rocky' uses yum and its successor, dnf which support automatic dependency
		resolution, versioning, and modular content, among other features.
	
	'Debian' uses apt

'aptitude' or 'apt'?

Both are package managing tools

apt: Advanced Packaging Tool

- Packaging Tool that manages the instalation and uninstalation of a software.
- was made to manage '.deb' packages
- compatible with 'rpm' package manager now.
    
    ****RPM Package Manager (RPM), originally called the Red Hat Package Manager,
        is an open source program for installing, uninstalling and managing
        software packages in Linux.

- 'apt' uses command lines without graphic interface.
- when installing and typing the package name,
- it installs the package and the dependencies to 
            '/etc/apt/sources.list' automatically.
        
        ***What are dependencies?
            In Linux, dependencies are libraries, packages, or modules
            installed in order to run a program smoothly. Sometimes, when we
            install a package, its dependencies are not installed
            automatically or may be missing. So, as a Linux administrator,
            knowing how to install these dependencies is essential.

        ***
            With 'apt', there is no need to worry about dependencies and it is
            very flexible since it is possible to do certain things like...
        ->
            maintaining the current package withoutbeing updated even though
            the user adds a new source list manually or when the system
            updates.


aptitude
        : Aptitude is vaster in functionality than apt-get and integrates
            functionalities of apt-get and its other variants including
            apt-mark and apt-cache.
        : While apt-get lacks UI, Aptitude has a text-only and interactive UI.
        : also run-able on text-based UI modes and on
            non-interactive command line modes. 

- if apt-get does things like...
    - installing packages.
    - upgrading packages.
    - system upgrade.
    - dependency check.

- aptitude can do lot more things like...
    - toggling package or package list installation to automatic or manual.
    - saving packages that cannot be used to the upgrade.
    
- Aptitude has a better package management than apt-get
    - Aptitude will automatically remove unused packages, while apt-get
        would need user to explicitly specify this by either adding
        additional option of ‘—auto-remove’ or specifying ‘apt-get
        autoremove"
    - To investigate further as to why certain action is getting blocked
        or why or why-not a certain action should be taken, Aptitude
        offers 'why' and ‘why-not’ commands.
    - While apt-get would probably die-out in case of conflicting action
        regarding installation or removal of package with a message,
        Aptitude can suggest possible measures to remove that conflict.
