***MAC - Mandatory Access Control
			- a security strategy that restricts the ability individual resource owners have to grant or
				deny access to resource objects in a file system.
			- 'MAC' criteria are defined by the system administrator, strictly enforced by the operating
				system (OS) or security kernel, and cannot be altered by end users.
			- a policy-based framework that establishes and enforces rules for users and processes
				when it comes to accessing files, directories, ports, and other resources.
			

SELinux - Security Enhanced Linux
		- a security module that applies 'MAC' to Linux operating systems.
		- makes use of 'labels' to implement a security context for different processes and resources.
		- Once an access request is made, SELinux compares these labels to a list of policies to
			decide whether to grant or deny that particular request.

			!Basically! - a security architecture for Linux Systems which
			enables the admin to manage system access management efficiently

AppArmor - Application Armor
		 - a security module that applies 'MAC' to Linux operating systems.
		 - utilizes 'profiles' to create and enforce rules on processes and resources.

			***'Profiles' are files that define the set of restrictions and permissions for processes
				and applications that try to access files, directories, ports, and other resources.
				Using these 'profiles', AppArmor can limit the privileges of different applications and
				processes to prevent unauthorized access to the resources of a device.
		
			!Basically! - a Linux Kernel System Module which
			enables the system manager to limit accessibility by program profile to program profile.
