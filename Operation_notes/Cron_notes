What is Cron?

Cron or cron job is a command line utility to schedule commands or scripts to happen at specific intervals or a specific time each day. Useful if you want to set your server to restart at a specific time each day.

    cd /usr/local/bin – to show monitoring.sh
    sudo crontab -u root -e – to edit the cron job
    change script to */1 * * * * sleep 30s && script path – to run it every 30 seconds, delete the line to stop the job from running.
