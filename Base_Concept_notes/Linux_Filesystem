---------------------------------------***Linux Filesystem - How each Directory is used***-------------------------------------------

Key point to understand how LINUX works:

	In Linux, everything is a file.
	- network settings
	- device, hard drives
	- commands used

	COMMANDS:
	
		whoami - shows who the user is

		ls - lists items of current directory

		cd - change current directory to the following directory
			cd .. - take us to the previous directory

		pwd - shows where you are
	
		clear - clears your terminal

		cat - concatenate (shows text of the file)

		cp - copy
			e.g.) cp ls -whatever command-

		sudo - getting access

		rm - remove

		which - shows which command is in which directory



	/ - root directory

	ls /
	
	/bin ------------ binary
	- directory which contains important executable programs and core operating system commands.
	- symbolically linked to /usr/bin
	
	/sbin
	- contains system essential files.
	- similar to the bin directory.
	- little practical difference between bin.
	- symbolically linked to /usr/sbin.
	- has special commands only administrators can use. 	e.g.) adduser
		
	/usr
	- contains most of the programs and utilities the system will be running.
	- not the same with user directory.
	- place most of the programs actualy reside.
	- where the bulk of the programs are located.
	- shared between all users and read only except via root or sudo command.
	- also contains bin and sbin.
		- contains /local directory for personalized commands.
	
	/home
	- location of the individual user home directories.
	- my documents directory in Windows.
	- in linux, the directory at start is the personal home directory.
	- contains configuration files specific to the user.

	/dev
	- contains the device files.
	- dynamically created based on the various physical and virtual devices that are connected to the system.
	- shows what connected to the system.
		- vda, vda1, ... means virtual disks.
		- sda, sda1, ... can be displayed like this as well.
			- these are hard drives, which are also files.
		
	/boot
	- directory which contains the files needed by the bootloader.
	- initial ram file system included as well as the kernel.
	
	/etc
	- contains critical configuration files and startup scripts.
	- use a lot to configure and edit SSH keys
	e.g. \\\ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config \\\

	/lib
	- hold the shared libraries the system's programs will need.
	- enable multiple programs to share code with each other.
	- increase efficiency.
	e.g. lib32, lib64, or more
	- like /bin symbolically linked to the user/lib.
	
	/lost+found
	- directory where broken files might reside after a system crash.
	
	/media
	- mount point for file systems stored on a removable media.
	- usb drives show here.
	- usually when drives are automatically mounted to the linux device.
	
	/mnt
	- where devices will be mounted temporarily.
	- to attach a network storage server for archive.
	- when drives are manually mounted to the linux device.

	/opt
	- is rarely used.
	- optional software packages are placed by a vendor.
	
	/proc
	- sudo file system.
		*sudo file system?
		- file system that is created at startup and disappears at shutdown.
	- contains information about every running process in the machine.
	- each active process has it's own subdirectory.
	- contains information about system.
	
	/root
	- home directory for the user.
	- has ultimate control over the system.
	- cannot view the contents of this directory without sudo.
	
	/run
	- contains information describing the system since boot time.
	- log in info, or deamon info.
	
	/srv
	- occasionally used as a folder for files served by a web server or other server mechanisms.
	- rarely used.
	
	/sys
	- contains information about devices, drivers, and kernel features running in the system.
	- like /proc, but better structured.
	
	/tmp
	- for temporary files

	/var
	- system specific variable files.
	- logs, temporary message files, spool files.
	
	[<Special note>]
	
	/dev
	- contains special files(device files) corresponding to physical devices or system components.

	/media
	- regular directory used to mount removable media like CD-ROMs, floppy disks, etc.
	
	/mnt
	- regular directory used to mount other filesystems, usually for a short period of time.
	
	[/dev] - is essential to the operating system and it cannot be removed.
	[/media] & [/mnt] - placeholder directories.
	--- removing them wouldn't influence the operating system core operation. ---
	
	[/dev] contains a reference to a physical CD-ROM drive
	[/mount] might contain a subdirectory which allows access to the files stored on the disc insterted
		 to the same CD-ROM drive.
	
	Typically, [/dev] (device) is where all physical devices are first mounted and [/mnt] (mount)
	is where additional link to the removable media is made.
	[/mnt] directory and subdirectories are intended for mount points to removable or temporary files storage.
	
	WHAT IS A MOUNT POINT?
	- directory on a file system that is logically linked to another file system.
	- utilized to make the data on a different physical storage drive available, in a folder structure.
	- Mount points are fundamental to Unix, Linux, and MacOS.
	
	Process:
	
	1. Plug USB to Linux. ->
	2. Detect hardware device and puts into file system at /dev/sdc1. ->
	3. Then execute command 'mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb' to mount the file system on
		the USB drive to the mount point location '/mnt/usb'
	4. To make the data more convenient, create an additional mount point with the command
		'mount /dev/sdc1 /home/john/files' to put the data in the home directory.

(The information about where the default mount points are loaded at system startup is located in /etc/fstab for many Linux distributions.)
	*fstab is a log.
	
-------- Windows can use mount points, but it is not common.
{	Removable storage devices like USB drives are automatically mounted at locations within the /mnt or /media directory.
		But in Windows, drive letters like C:, D:, or more, serve as mount points.					}
