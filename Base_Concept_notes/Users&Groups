	How to make Users (in Linux):
	
	in Terminal:
	
	adduser "Name"
	
	useradd "Name" <- more manual command


	Signing in as other Users:

	logout
	
	
	Deleting Users (in root User):
	
	deluser "Name"
	

	Changing the User's Password (in root User):
	
	passwd "Name"
	passwd <- change current user password


		Concepts:
			Primary and Secondary Groups
				- 1 Primary Group
				- 15 Secondary Groups
				- Every new file that is created is owned by User's Primary Group
				
			Primary Group
				- Anyone who is apart of the group has access/permission to the file
				
			Secondary Groups
				- Users can belong to multiple secondary groups
				- Can have files in a secondary group but only users in that specific group
				
			- Each user should have their own unique Primary Group and the Group is named exactly the same as the user.
				
	To add group:
	
	addgroup "Group Name"
	
	
	Assining User to Group:
	
	usermod -a -G "Group Name" "User Name"
		(a means to append, G means group)


	To see which group the User belongs to:
	
	groups "User"
	
	groups <- see group of the current user
	
	
	Removing User from Group:
	
	gpasswd -d "User Name" "Group Name"
		(d means delete)
		
	
	Editing Permissions:
	
		visudo <- opens /etc/sudoers.tmp <- need permission 
		(Shouldn't directly modify the /etc/sudoers file because when there is an error in the syntax since /etc/sudoers is only modifiable by root and
			will be stuck unless there is another way of gaining root. It should be run in safety guaranteed way like the visudo command.)

	go to ->  # User privilage specification
		root	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		User	ALL=/usr/bin/top, [so on and so forth]
			-> User now have access to /top command
	go to -> # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
		%sudo	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		%python	ALL=/usr/bin/ls, /usr/bin/less, /usr/bin/apt
			(/bin is where the standard commands are.)


	Finding Command Locations:

	which "Command Name"

	
	Deleting Groups:

	delgroup "Group Name"
