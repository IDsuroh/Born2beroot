********************************* Computer Memory *************************************

Everything in a computer's memory takes the form of basic units called...

	bits || binary digits

		- each bit us stored in a memory cell, which can switch between 2 states for 2 possible values.
		- those are ...
				   
					0000000000		 //       1111
			   	    00000        00000		//      111111	
			  	   00000          00000	       //  	  1111					
			 	   00000          00000	      //	  1111
			  	    00000        00000	     // 	  1111
			  	  	0000000000	    //	        11111111

				0s and 1s.

		- file and programs consist of millions of these bits that are all process in the ventral provessing unit, or CPU
			- CPU acts as the computer's brain.
		- computers have short-term memory for immediate tasks.
		- also long-term memory storage.

	When a program is run...
		- the operating system allocates area within the short-term memory for performing those instructions. 
			e.g.) when a key is pressed in a word processor,
					- the CPU will access one of those locations to retrieve bits of data.
					- it could also modify them, and create new ones.
					- the time it takes for this is called 
										"memory latency".
					- because program instructinos must be processed quickly and continuously,
						all locations within the short-term memory can be accessed in any order.
						- this is called,
									" RAM - Random Access Memory "
								most common type of RAM is "DRAM - Dynamic Random Access Memory"

									- each memory cell consists of a transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges.

	  	  	0000000000	    				11111111


{			Such is called 'Dynamic' because it only holds charges briefly before they leak requiring periodic recharging to retain data.		}

BUT!
	the latency of 100 nanoseconds is still slow.

	To help this,
		- there is a small high-speed internal memory cache made from "SRAM - Static Ramdom Access Memory".
			- SRAM is usually made up of 6 interlocked transistors which does not need refreshing.
			- it is the fasted memory in a computer system as well.
			- also the most expensive part of the computer.
			- and takes up 3 times more space than DRAM.

BUT!

	RAM and cache can only hold data as long as they are powered.
	Which means when power is shut down, the data must be transferred into a long-term storage device.

	

Long-term Storage Device

	
	Part 1 - Magnetic Storage

		- data is stored as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film.
		- because the disc must rotate to where the data is located in order to be read,
		- the latency of such drives is 100,000 times slower than that of DRAM.

	
	Part 2 - Optical-based Storage

		- like DVD, Blu-ray.
		- also uses spinning discs.
		- but with a reflective coating.
		- bits are encoded as light and dark spots using a dye that can be read by a laser.
		- even cheaper and is removable.
		- for that, they have even slower latencies than magnetic storage and lower capacity.


	Part 3 - Solid-state Drives

		- newest and fastest type of long-term storage.
		- like flash sticks, SSDs.
		- use floating gate transistors and have no moving parts.
		- it store bits by trapping or removing electrical charges within the internal structures.


Computer Memory is degradable.
	- the heat(from the device and/or environment) will demagnetize hard drives.
	- degrade the dye from Optical Media. (CD)
	- cause charge leakage in floating gates.
	- Solid-state Drives will corrode eventually due to the repetition of writing to the floating gate transistors.
