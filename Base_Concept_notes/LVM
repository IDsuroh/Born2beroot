LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
	- Allows the creation of 'groups' of disks or partitions that can be assembled into a single (or multiple) filesystems:
	- Can be used for any mount point except '/boot'
		- GRUB(Grand Unified Bootlader) cannot read LVM metadata
		* What is GRUB?
		Program that runs before the OS to ensure the kernel runs properly.
	
	- LVM is flexible for resizing of volumes.
	- allows SNAPSHOTS or copies of your logical volume
	
	EXAMPLE LAYOUT OF AN LVM GROUP							^	^	read from bottom to top
											^	^
file system - directory where the file systems or logical volumes are mounted too.	^	^
----------- [/]	      [/var]   [swap]    [/home]					^	^
Top ---- LV [lv_root] [lv_var] [lv_swap] [lv_home]					^	^
	Logical Volume - individual compoments that are partitions.			^	^
Above -- VG [vg_base]									^	^
	Volume Group - encompasses all physical volumes.				^	^
Bottom - PV [/dev/sda] [/dev/sdb] [/dev/sdc]						^	^
	Physical Volume - actual discs on the system.					^	^	-----------------------
	
	- Volume Group contains all the Physical Volumes
	- Logical Volumes are Volume Group carved up into smaller portions that are used for specific functions.
	- Logical Volumes or partitions need file system.
		e.g. XFS, ext4, or more
		
	COMMANDS for LVM:
	
	ls______
		-pvs = physical volume scan
			lists out the physical volumes in an LVM group.
		-vgs = volume group scan
			lists out the volume groups within an LVM group.
		-lvs = logical volume scan
			lists out the volumes within an LVM group.
